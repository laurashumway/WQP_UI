The Water Quality Data Portal (WQP) provides easy access to data stored in three large water quality databases through form-based queries or standalone web services. Submit a web service request to bypass the WQP form interface. This functionality can be used to share data queries simply with external partners or incorporate into applications. The form interface and the web services offer equivalent input parameters and output formats.  For more information on the WQP input parameters and data retrievals, see the [User Guide](http://www.waterqualitydata.us/portal_userguide.jsp).  

### **Using a web service client**

The WQP has language-specific web service tools that integrate easily with scripting languages. The application will do the heavy lifting to get the data into a familiar data format.

* R - The *dataRetrevial* package is a powerful tool that facilitates downloading data from the WQP and from a number of USGS NWIS services: 
    * [GitHub](https://github.com/USGS-R/dataRetrieval)
    * [Tutorial](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/dataRetrieval.html)
    * [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataRetrieval/index.html)
* Python - pyWQP on [GitHub](https://github.com/USGS-CIDA/pyWQP). This client has limited support at this time.

### **Submitting a Web Services Request**

Queries on WQP web services use a RESTlike (REpresentational State Transfer) technique. This method retrieves the *same* data as the WQP form. Query basics are outlined in the following series of tables. Most non-alphanumeric characters (such as punctuation) must be ["**url-encoded**"](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_url_encoding.htm), (*for example*: space is "%20").

Parameters must be appended to a base URL. Base URL construction depends on the type of information requested:

* [Base URL for downloading sites](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Station/search?)
* [Base URL for downloading results](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Result/search?)
* [Base URL for downloading activity data](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Activity/search?)
* [Base URL for downloading activitymetric data](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/ActivityMetric/search?)

Construct a RESTlike web service query by concatenating the base URL with the desired parameters and arguments, ***Table 1***.  At least one parameter-argument pair must be specified. Separate multiple parameter-argument pairs with an *ampersand* ("&"). If no *mime type* is specified, the retrieval will default to **WQX-XML format**. See the [User Guide](http://www.waterqualitydata.us/portal_userguide.jsp) for a list of elements included in the result retrievals.

However, sorting increases response time significantly, sometimes by orders of magnitude. If you are doing your own sorting after download, set sorted=no. For large downloads (over 5 million rows) sorting is disabled by default to ensure reasonable response times. XML requests are always sorted to accommodate the WQX data schema. |   |

### **Web Service Request Examples**

**All examples include \<remove this string> to avoid spurious web service calls from web crawler robots.**

>*Example:* REST web service request to retrieve sites from *Oklahoma County, Oklahoma*, where *Atrazine* was measured in *XML* format, *zipped*:

`https://www.water<remove this string>qualitydata.us/data/Station/search?countycode=US%3A40%3A109&characteristicName=Atrazine&mimeType=xml&zip=yes`

>*Example:* REST web service request to retrieve sites contained within a *bounding box* where *Caffeine* was measured in *KML* format, *zipped*:

`https://www.water<remove this string>qualitydata.us/data/Station/search?characteristicName=Caffeine&mimeType=kml&bBox=-92.8,44.2,-88.9,46.0&zip=yes` 

>*Example:* REST web service request to retrieve *Caffeine* sample results from sites contained within a *bounding box* and *collected on, or after, 10-01-2006* in *MS-Excel* format, *zipped*:

`https://www.water<remove this string>qualitydata.us/data/Result/search?characteristicName=Caffeine&bBox=-92.8,44.2,-88.9,46.0&startDateLo=10-01-2006&mimeType=xlsx&zip=yes` 

#### **Using POST instead of GET**

Water Quality Portal services can be accessed using an http POST, with a JSON payload, instead of an http GET. This is particularly helpful when submitting large lists of sites.

An example *JSON* submittal looks like this:

```
{
"organization": ["WIDNR_WQX"],
"siteid": ["WIDNR_WQX-133003", "WIDNR_WQX-133398", "WIDNR_WQX-133486"]
}
```

An example *curl* with that data looks like this:

```
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/zip' -d '{"organization":["WIDNR_WQX"],"siteid":["WIDNR_WQX-133003","WIDNR_WQX-133398","WIDNR_WQX-133486"]} \ 
 ' 'https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Station/search?mimeType=csv&zip=yes'
 ```

If there are any problems, they are returned in the response via the warning header(s). See [RFC 2616 Section 14](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.46) for the format of the warning header. 

#### **Web Service Request Pre-Validation**

A REST web service request may not be valid for all data providers. Perform a validation before submitting a request to ensure that all parameters are valid before making an expensive request for actual data. *For example*, the WQP mini-portal form performs a validation and pops up a prompt to the user if problems are found.

A validation service for sites and results requests is invoked by using the exact same RESTlike URL as an actual request, but uses a *HTTP HEAD* method rather than the usual *GET* or *POST*. See the W3C specification [RFC 2616 Section 9](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) for an explanation of HTTP methods. The exact way to invoke a URL via a HEAD request depends on your programming language, but an example is provided for *JavaScript*:

```
function makeRequest(url) {
  	var http = new XMLHttpRequest();
  	http.open('HEAD', url, false);
  	http.send();
  	var warningHeader = http.getResponseHeader("Warning");
  	alert(warningHeader);
}
```

Another option is using *command line*. For example, a HEAD request can be issued as:

```
curl -I 'https://www.water<remove this string>qualitydata.us/data/Result/search?bBox=-92.8,44.2,-88.9,46.0&startDateLo=10-01-2011 &mimeType=csv&characteristicName=Dissolved%20oxygen%20(DO)' 
```

If there are any problems, they are returned in the response via the warning header(s). See [RFC 2616 Section 14](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.46) for the format of the warning header. 

**NOTE**: The same warning header(s) and count headers are returned on the GET request. It is important to issue the command with 'debug' or 'verbose' diagnostic option turned on, and then inspect the header to ensure the service is performing as expected. *For example:*

```
wget -d -O - 'https://www.water<remove this string>qualitydata.us/data/Result/search?&bBox=-92.8,44.2,-88.9,46.0 &startDateLo=10-01-2011&mimeType=csv&characteristicName=Dissolved%20oxygen%20(DO)'
```

*or*

```
curl -v  'https://www.water<remove this string>qualitydata.us/data/Result/search?&bBox=-92.8,44.2,-88.9,46.0 &startDateLo=10-01-2011&mimeType=csv&characteristicName=Dissolved%20oxygen%20(DO)'
```

Either statement returns the following (indicating no NWIS results are returned):

```
Total-Site-Count: 170
EPA-Site-Count: 170
Warning: 299 NWIS "[characteristicName]The value of characteristicName=Dissolved 
                     oxygen (DO) is not in the list of enumerated values"
```

#### **Using OGC Services to map Water Quality Portal sites based on Water Quality Portal Parameters**

The Water Quality Portal has an endpoint for generating OGC-Compliant Geospatial web services. At this time, [Web Mapping Service (WMS)](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/services/wms/reference.html) version 1.1.1 and [Web Feature Service (WFS)](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/services/wfs/reference.html) version 1.1.1 are supported. The service is a customized version of the WMS and WFS services provided by [Geoserver](http://www.geoserver.org/). The base URL for the WMS and WFS Services is: 

`https://www.waterqualitydata.us/ogcservices/{wms|wfs}`

Use web mapping tools, such as *Leaflet* or *Openlayers*, to easily connect to these web map services. GIS tools such as *ArcGIS* and *QGIS* also connect to these web maps services.

WFS and WMS services require an additional parameter: "SearchParams" (a URL-encoded version of the WQP search parameters). The service supports calls up to up to 250,000 sites. Calls that return large numbers of sites will take longer to load for the first time, as a cache is populated; all subsequent responses will be much quicker. The cache is cleared after new data is loaded to the portal (once a day, at night).

At this time, we support WMS GetMap, WMS GetFeatureInfo, and WMS GetLegendGraphic.

**WMS Getmap** 
* For detailed information on constructing a WMS getmap request, please refer to the [GetMap documentation at the Geoserver site](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/services/wms/reference.html#getmap).  
* Here is an example GetMap Request for stream sites that have samples for *atrazine*:

`https://www.waterqualitydata.us/ogcservices/wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetMap&VERSION=1.1.1&LAYERS=wqp_sites&STYLES=wqp_sources&FORMAT=image%2Fpng&TRANSPARENT=true&HEIGHT=256&WIDTH=256&SEARCHPARAMS=countrycode%3AUS%3BcharacteristicName%3AAtrazine&SRS=EPSG%3A3857&BBOX=-15028131.257091932,-7.081154551613622e-10,-10018754.171394622,5009377.085697313`

#### **Looking Up Domain Values through Web Services**

The domains for retrieval parameter arguments may vary over time, as new data are added. The domain of values for the parameter arguments may be retrieved with a REST query. Use the domain-value base URL concatenated with the parameter name and arguments as shown in ***Table 2***.

Base URL for looking up domain values: `https://www.waterqualitydata.us/Codes/{endpointName}?{parameter}`

There needs to be at least one argument in the web service call. If you want all domain values, you can just specify the mimetype: e.g. mimeType=json.
